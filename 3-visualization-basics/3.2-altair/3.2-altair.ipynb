    "Again, we're specifying two main ideas here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How we want to _draw_ each observation (the \"geometry\")\n",
    "2. How we want to _encode_ each measurement of an observation (encoding `weight` as the x-coordinate and `horsepower` as the y-coordinate)\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the Altair library does a really good job of representing these concepts in a way that's cleanly separated, and this makes them more composable. I find it easier to tweak different pieces of the chart when they're clearly independently controllable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API design theory behind this comes from [_The Grammar of Graphics_](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html) by Leland Wilkinson, popularized in the R package [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham (see also [the `ggplot2` book](https://ggplot2-book.org/mastery.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two ideas above (drawing and encoding) are what the Grammar of Graphics calls \"layers\" or \"structures\" (there are seven, you don't often need all of them). What this theory does well is helps you think about them independently and combine them to get what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grammar of Graphics is widely regarded as a good idea and there are many Python libraries that implement something inspired by it. I like Altair best because it's the first one where the idea really clicked for me, but the others are good too.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also think that learning to think like the Grammar of Graphics wants you to also makes you better at using the other visualization libraries that aren't designed that way. It helps you (or at least it helps me) phrase the kind of thing I want to do so that I can go look for how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat:** We're not building things up from first principles in this notebook. We're going to see a little bit of how things compose, and sample a few things you can do with Altair. The scope of what you can do is huge, way beyond what we can discuss in detail. The goal here is to give you some examples to play with to start to understand the feel of the API, and a couple of cool advanced things you can do to entice you to learn more. Beyond that, my best advice is to explore the gallery and Stack Overflow."
